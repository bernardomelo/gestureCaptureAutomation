# gestureCaptureAutomation
- Included: .xml files generated by Appium Studio
- Included: .java file with code to bulk run all tests - only one .xml is generated tho.

- sdk tools adb should be installed to connect to real device
- ----------------------
- You can run .xml's files in Appium Studio to generate reports 
- or
- You can run bulk testing, or one by one, with PyCharm, AndroidStudio, Eclipse...
- But too much workaround to run it outside of Appium Studio
